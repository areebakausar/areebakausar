Here I am studying Computer Science in School of Engineering, developing MentView under UVA Entrepreneurship Group and researching about Sustainable Commerce at McIntire School of Commerce.

⚡ <b> Quick (Fun?) Facts </b>: I dropped out of High School in 8th grade to homeschool myself. I learnt English at age 13, moved to United States at age 16 and wrote my first line of code at age 19. Phew!
